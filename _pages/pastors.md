## Pastor Tha Hser

<img style="float:left;padding-right:20px" src="/static/img/photos/thahser.png" class="img-responsive" alt="">


One of seven children, Pastor Tha Hser Tun was the only child who was given the opportunity to get an education. His parents put him in the home of a distant relative and they allowed him to attend school. From 1977 to 1981, he studied at the Karen Baptist Theological Seminary in Burma. Although his school years were poverty-stricken, Pastor Tha Hser graduated successfully and chose to work as a missionary for five years among indigenous Karen who practiced animism and lived in the mountains. Pastor Tha Hser got malaria and almost died, but Godâ€™s mercy sustained him.

From 1987 to 1997, Pastor Tha Hser served as pastor for two churches: Tha Nay Kler and Amo Mission Church in Tavoy District. Due to political instability, Pastor and his family fled to Thailand. He lived in Maniloi and Htam Hin refugee camps where he also served as a pastor. In June 2003, Pastor Tha Hser and family were resettled in California where he learned English and assisted many refugees.

After moving to Phoenix in July 2007, Pastor Tha Hser immediately got involved in the Karen ministry. He supported his family by holding a full-time job as a factory worker at a printer repair company. In early 2009, the Arizona Karen Baptist Church was blessed to find the funding necessary for Pastor Tha Hser to quit his factory job and devote full time providing support and leadership at the church.

Pastor Tha Hser is thankful for his wife, who has always been supportive of his ministry. Pastor and Mrs. Tha Hser Tun have four children and three grandchildren. He is grateful to God for the privilege of serving Him, and also expresses his deepest appreciation to everyone for their continuing support and prayers.
